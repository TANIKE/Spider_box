This is a Quadruped Robot, it has a special case: a box.

I made this project in 2021, when I was at highschool. I bring it here to store my little achievement.

At the time I make it, I just have a bit knowledge about programming, so most of the code I get from many sources on the internet, I learn the main point and modify it for my purpose.

Now, I'm almost forget about how I did it, so I can't gives detail description about the code.

In general: this image is the workflow of this project
